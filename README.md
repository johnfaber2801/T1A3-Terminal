## Code Style

[PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) was implemented as style for the Python code written in this project.

## Text Analyzer features

### Feature 1

#### Basic Text Analysis

This feature will analyze the text that was input by the user prior the option menu, the analysis will count the number of words, characters, lines and paragraphs of the input text, as well as the lenguage of it. The results will be displayed in a list.

##### Note: 

lenguages will be displayed as 'EN' for english, 'ES' for spanish, 'DE' for German, etc...


### Feature 2

#### Word Frequency Analysis

Allow users to know the Top 5 most frequent words, the program will count and display how many times each word appears in the text.

### Feature 3

#### Keywords Extractions

Allow users to extract the most frequent non-stop words from the text. Additionally, provide contextual analysis by displaying the sentences where each keyword appears.

##### Note:

This process is set up to run the natural language process over texts written in English, Spanish, Italian, German, and French.


## Implementation Plan

The Text Analyzer project utilized the GitHub projects tool in order to execute features, tests, checklists, and any tasks related to the project. First, a creation of tasks for features 1, 2, and 3 was performed followed by checklists. example: Featuare #1 = 1.1 Build functions for counting words, Feature #1 = 1.2 Build functions for counting characters... etc. Then tasks such as error handlers, menu options, corrections, scripts, and more were specified. Majority of tasks contains comments, screenshots and sources links.

The implementation plan was reviewed and updated every day as well after tasks completed successfully, tasks completed at the end of the day were moved to the 'DONE' column list, while tasks not started yet were in 'TODO' column list, and the tasks being performed were in 'PROGRESS' column list. I created a new column named 'ISSUES' for tasks that presented difficulty issues.

The first screenshot below shows the timeline of the duration of the project with the dates of the tasks completed.
